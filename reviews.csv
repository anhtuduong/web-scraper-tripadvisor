He took insane caution when choosing foods that could fit my dietary needs, too.

A must try experience,"It was my first time in Vietnam and I wanted to try all kinds of food in here. I decided to book a food tour with these folks and it was completely worth it. We started at the hostel I was staying in Old Quarter, Hanoi and I assumed that I am going to visit all the places I have been seeing on Instagram. But to my surprise, Long, our food tour guide, took us to inner parts of Old quarter, which was quieter and less crowded. We had Fried Fish Noodles, Summer roll(which we were taught to make), fried Spring Roll, Fried Sweet Donut, Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich), Bún chả and Local beer. All these were from different local restaurants across Old quarter which we couldn’t have found out by ourselves. We also had egg coffee and coconut coffee which I thought would be weird after having so much food and beer, but it wasn’t at all. The entire walk was properly planned and we felt very light even after eating so much. And it wasn’t just the food. We also discovered a lot about Vietnamese culture, history, people, the language, all thanks to Long. We ended the tour with coconut ice cream with fresh mango pieces. It was so flavourful and not just sweet. Long also helped me to plan my upcoming schedule in Hanoi. Thanks folks for such a beautiful experience.

Fun food experience in Hanoi,"We had an amazing night food tour with Lucky. Before we started the tour, he asked us a few questions about our stay in Hanoi and our food preference which he used to plan our food itinerary.
              

              We had Banh mi, xoi xeo ngo or the turmeric sticky rice, green papaya salad and steamed rice pancake. For dessert, we had the refreshing and not-so-sweet coconut ice cream with mixed fruits. Among the dishes we had, the green papaya salad was my favorite.
              

              The highlight of the tour was the visit to the train street. We were supposed to have egg coffee, but as we got so thirsty after a couple of hours of walking, we opted for the cool lemonade. We reached there 15 minutes before the train passed by, just enough time to rest and take a lot of photos. It was quite a thrilling experience having drinks so close to the passing train.
              

              Overall, the food tour was such a fun, exciting, filling trip where we also got to learn more about the culture of Vietnam through their food as explained by Lucky. He was so eloquent in telling us a few stories about Vietnam cuisine and food culture and he did it in a very entertaining and interesting manner.

Minh’s fabulous street food tour…and more!,"Waiting just outside our hotel unsure what or who was to great us we were approached by a colourful figure, marching purposefully towards us, who presumably was going to be our guide for today! Minh with his shock of blonde hair only hidden by an unassuming cap, but contrasted with his vibrant sheepskin waistcoat danced up to us with a purposeful take no prisoners attitude, suggesting you better be ready for the day because I’m going to take you for a wild culinary experience, and so we proceeded hastily. Juxtapose to the gloomy day that met us in Hanoi, the tour was full of delightfully vibrant and delicious food, taking us to the lesser known but highly addictive street food eateries that dominant the old quarter of Hanoi. Each place we visited specialised in their own unique style of dish and recipes that as Minh explained were closely guarded secrets and the beating heart of this intoxicating city. While the food got ever more delectable, the size of the stools became smaller and smaller, which with our increasingly filled stomachs, began to test the integrity of these tiny implements, and causing our host great dels of amusement. Minh interspersed the tour with a wealth of invaluable knowledge about his beloved home, where to go and what to avoid, alongside some of his own interesting anecdotes about Vietnamese tradition. The tour not only provided as with delicious food and full bellies but an increased appreciation of the importance of street food to this part of the city and clearly to our fabulous host Minh.

Highlight of our Hanoi trip - Minh is the best tour guide ever!,"This food tour was the highlight of our time in Hanoi.
              

              Minh was our guide and he was the best part of the tour. He talked so openly with us about Hanoi culture, people, lifestyle and food. He is so funny and full of good humour, which made our tour so enjoyable. We learnt so much about Vietnam through the eyes and ears of a true local!
              

              Minh was also SO CARING AND ATTENTIVE. I was feeling very unwell before the tour even started and Minh looked after me so closely, making sure I was comfortable and ordering me a special ginger tea at every stop and giving me local tips to help my pain. I was completely cured by the end of the tour - thanks to Dr Minh! He really went ABOVE AND BEYOND to look after us. We were so grateful for his kindness!
              

              The food stops were fantastic and were all places that we would never have found or thought to try on our own. Some of the best memorable food we had in Vietnam were Minh’s recommendations! We left comfortably full and so fulfilled by all the new exciting flavours we got to try.
              

              I recommend doing this tour early on in your Hanoi trip as you will want to go back to many of the places after, and Minh also gave us a full email of recommendations afterward for the best Hanoi eats and nearby regions.

"Forget the other food tours, book this one.","This food tour is downright amazing. This is the perfect tour to start off your time in Hanoi as you will not only be introduced to a lot of great types of food and street food places, but also learn more about Hanoi in general, all the way down to nailing how to cross the busy streets. Our guide Minh was fun, engaging and professional and speaks great English. He gave many recommendations for places to eat and much more in Hanoi as well as other big cities, both during and after the tour. You get to eat in places you never would have found yourself and most of the food you would never have tried on your own or it will be in a different format/have a twist to it from what you’re used to. The guide Minh tries to empower you to be a traveler, not a tourist, which I think is fantastic.
              

              Three tips before going:
              
              1. Book through Airbnb (cheaper than TripAdvisor)
              
              2. Don’t eat too much before. Seriously, we got at least 9 servings, and I was comfortably full before then with an empty stomach.
              
              3. Bring hand sanitizer
              

              The tour also takes your food preferences/allergies into consideration, so let them know beforehand. Water and beer is included (but don’t drink too much, less room for food).
              

              Enjoy the tour, highly recommended!

Amazing food tour with Minh,"I went to this tour as a solo traveler on my last day of Hanoi and I really should’ve went on the first day. The food that I ate on this food tour was what I had been searching for my whole time in the city that I could not find. I went to the Michelin recommended spots that my hotel had suggested but you really do need to go with a local if you’re also a foodie looking for true authentic Vietnamese street food. I had Minh as a tour guide and I’ve not met many people who are better at their job than Minh. He’s funny, knowledgeable, caring, and just overall is a good person and has great energy. I was in a group of 5 and there were 3 people with dietary restrictions: gluten free, vegetarian, and peanut allergy so Minh really had his work cut out for him. He did an amazing job bringing us around to places where everyone would be accommodated without sacrificing on taste at all bc everything was truly delicious. Also highly recommend as a solo traveler bc you get to try a lot of things vs ordering a dish at a restaurant and then getting full which was a main problem I had. At the end, Minh also gave us a bunch of recommendations for Hanoi and other cities in Vietnam which would have been so helpful on my first day. All in all, highly highly recommend.

Learning the culture,"Minh was a knowledge and personable guide. His familiarity with the foods and restaurants was impressive, and his insistence that the five people on the food tour stay close to him ""like sticky rice"" when we crossed the street was humorous ... and good advice. I highly recommend this activity for anybody who loves food and a little adventure.","August 23, 2023",5.0,Venture48391522076,,6,Solo,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

Amazing Night food tour with Minh,"We booked our trip for 1st full night of our stay, (2 adults and 1 child aged 12), thinking what better way to experience Hanoi Old Quarter and food than with a local.
              

              Minh arrived a few minutes before the pick up time and talked about what we did or didn't like, allergies etc, so he could customise the tour if needed which was a nice touch but not needed in this case
              

              The tour lasted just over 3 hours and the cost includes all the food and drink. Wanted to comment as it wasn't 100% clear when we booked.
              

              Minh took us to 7 different restaurants/ cafes/ vendors across all food types, including some of his local favourites, which let me tell you are amazing, and you would never find without him.
              

              Minh used the tour to talk to us about the culture and food, encouraging us to ask questions about anything as life is significantly different to back in the UK. He engaged with our daughter throughout getting her involved with the food and conversation, given she was the only child was a nice touch.
              

              As the tour drew to a close Minh took our details and followed up with an email with the name and addresses of then places we had eaten, as we travelling Vietnam he gave us recommendations for our other stops where he had also visited.
              
              From a food perspective, we had:
              

              Pho (dry and broth)
              
              Permello Juice
              
              Chocolate bread
              
              Fish Rolls
              
              Fish Noodles (Amazing)
              
              Summer rolls
              
              Banh Mi
              
              Pudding restraunt ( I can't remember what it was,but it was amazing)
              

              We would highly recommend the food tour and definitely ask for Minh he made the tour really special and we are still talking about what a highlight it was for us in Hanoi, and set us really well or travelling the rest of the country","August 21, 2023",5.0,Stevie b,"Bradford, UK",7,,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

He tailored the tour to the individuals in our group in terms of food choices, number of stops, and vibe. This is a sign of expertise. Then to communicate on top of that in such a way that we get informative but authentic information about the culture, history, city vibe, food— that is a talent. I loved his communication style which is relaxed, thorough, and engaging. The food picks were excellent! Minh is quite knowledgeable with all the food in the area which allowed him to tailor the picks thoughtfully. I felt well cared for in his hands. He loves this job and it shows. He is great at it.

Must-Do Ultimate Food Tour !!,"Minh is the best!! Me and my mom learned so much about Ha Noi and Minh really encouraged questions to have everyone talking and having a good time on our tour. We had pho soup, chicken salad, summer rolls, fried fish, fish rolls, banh mi, pomelo juice, mango sticky rice and icecream, and egg coffee at so many different restaurants (mainly street food vendors) and we went through beer street also. We felt full but each new food aas so delicious we would always end up finishing it. I would never have been able to find such delicious food and he really knew what to order which took the stress of deciding off of our shoulders and we could not be happier. Definitely the best food I have had in Vietnam and the best pho and banh mi and I have had so many banh mi’s and bowls of pho in my last 12 days I have spent here in Vietnam. Him speaking English to us to explain everything, knowing his way around to each restaurant and paying each restaurant for us really made us able to just soak it all in amd enjoy the food. Minh was accommodating to any allergies and listened to what we wanted to do to and explained all of the food and how to eat it so we learned so much. He is so nice and funny, and was always making jokes and making sure everyone felt included and had a good time. One of my favorite memories of Vietnam, and I would even do it again in a heartbeat (even though it was raining the whole time)! It’s a must-do, you won’t regret it!!","July 31, 2023",5.0,Clare,"Falls Church, VA",23,Family,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

The perfect night out,"Minh was an exceptional tour guide. Within our tour we are delicious food, learnt a lot about the history of Hanoi, the landmarks in the city, and Vietnamese culture.
              

              Starting with the food. Every item we ate was incredible. This is now my 10th day in Vietnam. We visited 7 different locations and every place was the best food of my trip.
              
              Without a tour guide I would not have found any of these locations or had the courage to try them. A truly authentic Vietnamese experience.
              

              Secondly Ming’s knowledge of the city and its landmarks was vast and comprehensive. He answered all questions we asked with ease and in detail. He also taught us a lot about the culture of the people in Vietnam and spoke with honesty and authenticity.
              

              Lastly I wish I had have done this the first day of my trip because Minh provided a ln itenary of the best way to explore all of Vietnam even including places to eat outside of north Vietnam. The value for money is astounding.
              

              Minh was also very personable and really bought a seemingly group of strangers together l. There wasn’t an awkward moment and it was a lot fun. Thank you Minh for an unforgettable night","July 23, 2023",5.0,Scott B,,5,,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

She even tailored what kinds of foods to have us try based on our preferences! At some point, I was too full to keep eating but we still had a few dishes left. So Candy took us to a slightly out of the way area so we could take a longer walking break between eating 😆 And above all, we had a genuinely enjoyable time chatting with her, getting to know her and a little more about Vietnamese culture.

A real opportunity to find hidden gems,"When we first met near the lake at an, admittedly delicious, make your own spring roll place, at first my heart sank. There were food tours with tourists shoulder to shoulder back to back wedged into every restaurant you could see. I was afraid this was going to be exactly what I was looking to avoid.
              

              I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. Minh, fabulous and fantastic, phenomenal storyteller and orator, took us to incredible hidden places I would have never found on my own. The food at each stop more delicious than the last, including his favourite fusion of North and South in a completely unique noodle and fish dish that even fish skeptics will love.
              

              This was some of the most fun I had on my entire trip in Vietnam and accessed so many things I would have never been able to find on my own let alone have the confidence to try.

Perfect culinary and cultural introduction to Hanoi (with Minh),"We did our food tour with Minh an hour after arriving to our airport and we are so grateful we did!
              

              The tour was a perfect introduction to Hanoi, from how to cross the street (!!!) to an overview of the different areas within the Old Quarter.
              

              We were hesitant a food tour would be touristy but Minh curated an 8-stop/2.75 hour tour of his favorites. Everything was so delicious and things I’ve never eaten before or different spins on what I’ve had (and in the US I eat Vietnamese food as often as I can when I have access to good Vietnamese food).
              

              We ate a delicious variety of cuisine, got interest anecdotes and education on the food, history and culture of the city and in good company (groups are capped at 6 people) with an incredible guide.
              

              Minh is hilarious, knowledgeable and personable. On top of providing us excellent recommendations for Vietnam in general, he tailored the tour to what our stomachs were telling us and every bite was so tasty - the hardest part was pacing ourselves. You will not leave the tour hungry!

During our tour, he gave us instructions on how to eat certain food such as bun cha and explained some historical facts along the way to spark our curiosity for Vietnamese food culture.

              Booking a food tour curated towards your taste buds and from a local foodie guide is something I highly recommend after my experience. Navigating your way through Vietnam for food can be intimidating and frustrating especially if you do not speak the language. A lot of times, places that were recommended online or listed on Google suddenly closed and do not exist anymore so going on a food tour can really help save you the headache and hassle.

At each place we went he took care of everything, ordering for us and finding a table, making the experience very smooth.  All of the food and drinks were amazing! As we ate Luke told us about the history of the food, where it comes from, and how to eat all the dishes.  Luke was a great conversationalist and great at answering all the questions we had about Hanoi.  He was a very funny and positive person.  As the tour progressed, he asked us how we felt and how much more we wanted to eat, adjusting his plan as we went to fit our cravings.

A must-book while in Hanoi. Ask for Chung!!,"I cannot recommend this tour enough.  You should request Chung specifically! He has lived in Hanoi for decades, he has been a tour guide in Hanoi since 2003!   Along with being very knowledgeable and teaching us cultural details about Vietnam and the way of life there, he is also someone you can feel comfortable having a meal with.
              

              I’ll sum it up like this: after we had departed the tour, paid, and been on our way, about an hour later we were walking in the Old Quarter shopping  and looking for a good silk shop.  Chung walked up behind us and said hello and asked me how he could help! We said we were looking to buy silk and he escorted us a few blocks away to an amazing silk shop that gave us special attention so we could buy all the Vietnamese silk goods we wanted.
              

              This tour didn’t feel about just getting what we paid for, but about being shown the food and culture here and being made to feel a part of it.

These guys are awesome!,"This was my favorite tour in Hanoi . Chung and Luke bring great energy and a great attitude. Words cannot describe how much fun my wife and I had on the scooter tour. My wife was concerned about safety since it's a scooter tour and how chaotic Hanoi is but honestly the fun took over the fear in a matter of minutes.
              

              They brought us to several sites and gave us a bit of history behind each visit. For me I'm a huge history guy so this was right up my ally. Just awesome !  The tour also includes several food visits and we got to try different foods which was super cool! For us the Bun Cha and Egg coffee were our favorites
              

              I'm a very cautious person and this was definitely out of my comfort zone but again these guys bring great energy and I forgot about my concerns
              

              The only downside for us was that this was such a great tour it was very hard for the other tours to match. So not really much of a downside.
              

              I never review trip advisor so for me to put down a review shows how much fun we had.
              

              Thanks Chung and Luke for making our first visit to Hanoi a very memorable one.
              

              By the way these guys take photos for you on their phones and forward you the pictures so don't worry too much about whipping your phone out. I would like to also add that these guys are good motorcycle riders and do not attempt anything dangerous or risky there main focus is safety and for you to have fun
              

              Thanks Chung and Luke.! We will definitely book this tour again not so much for the site seeing but just to hang out with great individuals

"The best food tour you could hope for, tailored to you and your family.","Mr. Ha was recommended personally by our hotel and we could not have been happier with the tour. He asked us what we had already tried, or had plans to try elsewhere, and then tailored the tour to fill the gaps as well as our level of ""adventurousness"". He asked what we wanted to try and made sure we didn't miss those things.
              

              The best part is that this wasn't just a food tour, this was a history and culture tour of Vietnam from the south to the north. He took us to places that expressed the foods of each region and gave us the history of the food and why it was different for each area. He also told us a little about the history of each family that owned the places we stopped at, and sometimes the stories of those areas of the city. He didn't take us to the ""popular places"", he took us to places that were the best local flavors and told a story. This was exactly the kind of local tour we were hoping for. To wrap things up he sent us a ""food diary"" with the names, addresses and foods of each place we tried. Also in there was a link to his website and how to make egg coffee for ourselves.
              

              We started with varied foods and then ended with egg coffee and egg beer (yes, egg beer) and ice cream for the kids (and maybe the adults too). There were stops in there for sugar cane drinks for the kids and Bia hơi (fresh local beer brewed daily) for the adults. He tailored the pace to us so we never felt rushed but never felt like we were wasting time.

              B arrived promptly at our hotel at 11a and introduced himself to our small and good-natured group (2 lovely UKs).  B was very considerate of food allergies- my boyfriend was vegan and another in our group preferred vegetarian.  B made sure to have an appropriate selection for them at each place.
              

              We walked through the bustling streets of Hanoi Old Quarter and sampled several yummy local dishes - bun cha, spring rolls, bahn cuon, pho, bahn mi, a variety of desserts, and egg coffee.  Each dish was very tasty- I especially liked how each dish was freshly made with simple ingredients by locals.  We were pretty full from all of the delicious street food (and knowledge) by the end of the tour.
              

              Make sure you request B as your tour guide- he is very personable, speaks really great English, and has a nice balance of humor and knowledge about not only the best local street food, but also about the local culture/history of Hanoi and Vietnam in general.  We had a mini language lesson, toured through a residential alleyway, stopped by some interesting sites. Through it all, B patiently and thoroughly answered all of our questions. I definitely feel like I had a better understanding of Hanoi after hanging with B.
              

              B- thank you for an excellent tour of your favorite food spots- we wish you lots of luck in pursuing your Graphic Design degree and hope to cross paths again soon!","February 11, 2020",5.0,Rachel M,"Oakland, CA",43,,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

A must before you try street food on your own!,"If you're planning to enjoy all that Vietnamese food has to offer (and you should), that includes street food.  To get you familiar with names and knowledge of the various types of food, you MUST use a knowledgeable local guide to show you the ropes!
              
              That's exactly what HA Food tours is about, and our guide Luke (a native of Hanoi), confidently navigated the streets with many stops at local food places.  My wife and I (along with one other couple), felt very confident in the quality and the freshness of all the dishes we had, yum, yum, yum!  Luke picked us up on time at our hotel, and even had a plastic rain poncho for us as it was raining slightly (didn't last very long).

We tried a variety of foods, but not exactly as mentioned on the ad. All still very tasty! Only minor issue was we were not full. The group was a little embarassed to speak up but I did, and we ended up going to one more stop however compared to the photos shown on other reviews we had small serving portions. Eg, the Bahn mi rolls cut into thirds, two cups of rice with the bean curd shared amongst five of us, the pancake was one between us all. The noodle soup dish was the only thing we didn't share. Overall it was a fantastic night and the food was very tasty.","January 24, 2020",4.0,cbayssari,,81,,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

The banh mi and the deserts were a highlight for me and B said we should trust him with the egg coffee which I didn’t want to try and he was right. He catered for my vegetarian partner and found large chairs for me as my arthritis makes it difficult for me to sit on the small stools that are common. A kind and thoughtful guide.

A Great Introduction to the flavors of Hanoi - ask for Luke!,"We hopped on this food tour within hours of arriving in Hanoi, stomachs empty and eager. We couldn’t have imagined a better way for a pair of food lovers to start off their time in Hanoi!
              

              Our tour guide Luke Tran was the best. He deftly navigated us trough the busy streets of the Old Quarter, taking us to food spots each better than the last. We had bahn my, bo nuong, nem lui, bun cha, kem xoi, and a few helpings of the local draft beer, bia hoi. As Luke explained, the variety of foods we were eating reflect the history of Vietnam and Hanoi through encounters with other cultures. But most importantly, they reflect Vietnam’s history of blending traditions to make something authentically (and deliciously) Vietnamese.
              

              Luke and his fellow tour guide were friendly, gracious, and enthusiastic. We peppered them with a million questions, all of which they were happy to answer. We never felt overwhelmed at any point. They also asked the group before the tour about dietary restrictions and were happy to accommodate those on the tour with specific allergies & needs.
              

              In addition, we also feel like we have a much better handle on navigating the Old Quarter ourselves after touring through a lot of it with Luke.
              

              We would highly recommend this tour (with Luke if possible) to any hungry travelers looking to get the lay of the land in Hanoi.

Food Tour around Old Quarter,"Me and my friend joined Luke, along with his apprentice and an Australian couple, for his food tour around Hanoi Old Quarter. Luke was very funny, friendly and passionate about Hanoi and the foods we got to try. Overall, we tried 6 different dishes as well as sugarcane juice, Vietnamese coffee and the local 20p beer!
              
              It was an amazingly fun night and one of the best and most memorable of our entire stay in Vietnam. Luke was able to talk to us about the culture and history of Hanoi Old Quarter which was very interesting.
              
              I’d do the whole evening with Luke again if I could!
              
              I definitely recommend this if you’re new to Vietnam and want to appreciate a lot of the culture through the foods you eat, or even for the experienced traveller to go to spots you may not know about yet.
              
              Luke sent us an email afterwards with what we ate and where, as well as a long list of other places to eat.

We went from starters (Dried Beef Salad and Spring Roll); main course (Bun Cha, Dried Chicken Pho, Banh Mi); dessert (Pamelo with Coconut Milk and Longan Lotus Seed); signature Vietnamese Coffee ( egg chocolate, egg coffee).

But it was not only the food that amazed us - also the general intro and infos about the average Vietnamese' everyday life that Cherry explained us were full of new insights.

I booked a group tour, but our party of 4 were the only guests for the evening. Highly recommend the Hanoi Food Tasting tour. All the locations were a short walk within the old quarter. The 2.5 hours flew by and the walk wasn’t at all tiresome, because of the several stops. We stopped at 8 locations, of varying sizes, trying different dishes and drinks. As an Asian-American from Houston, TX, I’ve had plenty of Vietnamese food, much of it likely American-ized. Despite this, our group enjoyed all the meals throughout the tour. Having Luke with us, allowed us to stop at locations we probably would have been too intimidated to try on our own. But with Luke there, we knew the food would be good and safe to eat. At each location, Luke explained the dish and its relevancy to Vietnamese customs. Luke was also our guide through the old quarter, explaining its history and sharing insight into Hanoian daily life.

Amazing experience,"We had a private street food tasting tour with Jenny this evening. We have travelled a lot but this evening was by far the best experience we have had. Jenny took us to seven places - sometimes eating outside on the street and sometimes inside. She was very knowledgeable about the foods we ate and told us about the people making the food. Secret recipies handed down through generations; a family cooking a fish dish who restored a temple dedicated to mums and other very interesting anecdotes. We began with Bun Cha. Very delicious! Our favourite was deep fried Spring Rolls made by a husband and wife team whose day begins at 4am going to the market and then cooking from 9am to 9pm.
              
              Anyone can buy street food but you miss out on so much doing it on your own. We learned how to eat it, what to choose depending on our tastes and where to find the best food! Also to really appreciate the Vietnamese culture you need to take a street tour and hear the history of Hanoi and its people.
              
              Jenny was professional but friendly. She was interested in us and very careful to keep us safe in the traffic and ensure we had a great time! I highly reccomend a tour with Jenny.","June 26, 2019",5.0,bernadettecarr,"Newry, UK",17,,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

Fantastic food tour of Hanoi,"We highly recommend this walking food tour of Hanoi. We booked the day before our arrival in Hanoi after deciding it would be a good idea to have someone guide us around on our first night in Vietnam. We were met by Luke at our hotel and traveled a short distance to the Old Quarter. Luke was a great host and quickly introduced us to crossing Hanoi streets (not quite as difficult as it first appears) and eating delicious street food in local establishments that I think it’s fair to say we would never have had the confidence to find or try otherwise. Luke also introduced us to a lot of the history of Vietnam and Hanoi in particular. He also had an obvious love for street food and his enthusiasm rubbed off on us quickly. The tour lasted about 3 hours and was extremely good value for money. We would highly recommend it. In fact, we enjoyed this tour so much that we just completed a similar tour in Saigon (although this time on motorbikes). It may seem daunting from the outside looking in, but just jump in and embrace the food and culture. You won’t regret it!

I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is spending some time in Vietnam and is unfamiliar with the local foods and restaurants, it's a great orientation course.  We made many stops and ate loads of food, so much that we couldn't finish the food at the last couple of stops.

We took this tour shortly after arriving in Hanoi and it was the best way to introduce us to the city. We learned about the history of Hanoi, how the streets are set up, and great places to check out after the tour. In addition to the food, Luke provided tips on how to navigate the city. We got to practice crossing the street like a local which was key to getting around.
              

              The food stops were amazing! We stopped at a number of local eateries and tried many dishes. At each stop, Luke explained the cultural significance and how each of the ingredients compliment each other. He also helped us navigate how to eat each dish. Luke took my food allergy (gluten) into consideration and verified with the locals to ensure the dishes were gluten free. I did not get sick! If you have a gluten allergy, it’s often difficult to navigate street food but with Luke’s help, I was able to partake in all of the food stops. He even wrote a note in Vietnamese on my phone for me to use after the tour to communicate my allergy to the locals.
              

              The day was a rainy day and even so, we had a wonderful time!!

A wonderful evening with a fantastic guide and superb food choices.,"My friend and I joined four other travelers for an evening tour. Our guide was Trang (English name: Jenny), who was fantastic. I feel like we were really lucky to have her as our guide. She is incredibly kind, smart, easy to talk to and an all round enjoyable person to spend an evening with. Her English is exceptional and I soon forgot that I was speaking to a non native speaker. She explained to us in great detail about the ingredients and history of the food we were eating as well as giving us insightful information about the shops, streets, Vietnamese language and culture in general. She was always happy to able to answer any questions we had and cater to anything we needed.
              

              We went to nine different places over the course of the evening and each and every place was somewhere I would go again. It was quite difficult to choose which food I enjoyed the most because it was all so mouth wateringly delicious.
              

              Trang/Jenny sent us an email that same night after the tour finished with the names and addresses of all the places we ate at and the names of the foods we tried. I will definitely be going back to some of them before I leave Hanoi. She also included in the email some recommendations of places we didn’t visit on the tour, which was much appreciated.
              

              Overall, I highly recommend this food tour with Trang/Jenny as a ‘must do’ for anyone visiting the beautiful city of Hanoi.","March 16, 2019",5.0,_kingchristoph,"Asahikawa, Japan",2,Friends,

"Outstanding guide, great food, with one note on the tour itself.","B was a really really fantastic tour guide- a university student whose English is immaculate, including very casual turns of phrase.  He also understood us even when we talked quietly or quickly.  He explained the food very clearly and we had fun getting to know him a little bit.
              

              One bit of criticism TO THE TOUR, not to the guide (which as I said before, the guide was the perfect guide) - The tour apparently includes only 1 bottle of water and 1 beer per 2 people.  That isn't nearly enough given all of the salt being consumed.  Also the tour description does not specify that limit clearly.  Water and beers at these places are dirt cheap.  It wouldn't be that big a deal to charge $3 more pp for the tour and allow 3 drinks per person, which would be much more reasonable.
              

              Until/unless that is changed, I suggest to travelers to bring your own water bottle.","March 9, 2019",5.0,Brad S,,33,Couples,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

              Before this food tour I did not have the confidence to order food other than Pho. Cherry taught us the names of the dishes and even sent a follow up list of the places we visited with addresses and name of the food we tried.
              

              My favourite main was the papaya salad with beef jerky, and for desert the icecream with sticky rice topped with pieces of coconut was delicious.
              

              We also learnt about the different types of cooking in Vietnam depending on the area which was really interesting.

This tour actually had the most food also and I would recommend you go on an empty stomach! She also emailed a list afterwards of other places to visit if we had time which was a nice touch.

              We really enjoyed the banh my (bread rolls with meat), egg coffee and the Spring rolls (where we did the wrapping ourselves) she brought us to. The beef salad, rice noodle (we had the dry variety) and the mango sticky rice (the mango wasn't sweet) were not as outstanding.

Could not recommend this tour highly enough!!!,"We were a group of three on a trip through SE Asia during a break from grad school/college. This tour was one of the highlights of our entire vacation! Our guide, Jenny, was not only impressively fluent in English but was a wealth of knowledge with respect to Hanoi and Vietnamese cuisine/culture.
              

              We were picked up at our hotel. Our tour probably made about nine stops total but the lot of us were more than stuffed after four. The people of Vietnam seem to take exceptional pride in their food and with good reason. Every place that Jenny took us to was truly amazing. My favorite stops were for the following:
              

              Nem - Deep fried spring roll (the best one you will have in Vietnam)
              
              Cá cuốn- Fish rolls (was really surprised how much I liked this)
              
              Bánh mỳ- Vietnamese sandwich (bread was exceptionally light)
              
              Egg coffee (must try)
              
              Kem xôi- Sticky rice with coconut ice-cream (need i say more?)
              

              We had done a self guided walk of Hanoi during the day but Jenny was invaluable in providing insider knowledge of the city and ably handled all the questions we threw at her. The old part of Hanoi is littered with street food vendors but it was comforting to know that someone had already done the tough job of picking out the best ones.

"If there were 6 stars to give, Derek and this tour would get it","I did the street food tasting tour with Derek as our guide.  Absolutely phenomenal.  I have been in Vietnam 3 weeks now and have been on multiple more elaborate, expensive non-food tours in that time.  This 3 hr. walking tour may be my favorite overall tour thus far.
              

              You spend ~3 hrs. walking around the Old Quarter trying a variety of dishes.  While this may sound simple (and it is), it's so good.   You see a ton of things you wouldn't otherwise see, interspersed with a bunch of delicious food and, for those so inclined, beer!
              

              More than a food tour, Derek imparts his local knowledge not just of the food but of the history of the Old Quarter.  For example, one of our stops (for Spring Rolls) was at a place adjacent to the home where his grandfather used to live.  The spring roll place has been around 40+ years, the woman running it now took it over from her mother and will pass it to her daughter.  And was one of his favorite places as a kid and still to to today.  And it's little more than a sidewalk frying pan....as authentic local as it gets.  And it was crazy busy with locals coming up....always a good sign.
              

              Do yourself a favor, book this tour and if possible get Derek, he was amazing.  Thank you Derek for such a great afternoon.","December 31, 2018",5.0,Happy_Traveller28282,"San Francisco, CA",18,Solo,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies

Definitely recommend trying!,"We had a great time getting to try some different Vietnamese food thanks to our awesome guide, Linh. She met us at our hotel lobby and from there lead us through six destinations over the next three hours. The restaurants were relatively easy to navigate with our small group, and Linh amusingly called ""sticky rice"" each time we were to cross the street to the next place. Linh also taught us some helpful Vietnamese phrases along the way and explained the meaning behind the foods we were eating. We highly recommend this excursion to anyone looking to get a better understanding of Vietnamese food and culture. It's also a good way to get to know the Old Quarter of the city better.

              Lam turned out to be a superb guide. His English was perfect and his knowledge of the food as well as the history of Hanoi was excellent. The tour was tailored to our tastes along the way. We had already tasted a few different foods  in the days before the tour so Lam skipped these and made other suggestions.
              

              The streets were jam packed with Christmas Eve revellers and the traffic was  a nightmare. Lam guided us safely through the chaos with the upmost care.

              Myanh Truong was our guide for this particular food tasting tour around Hanoi, and we weren't dissapointed with her guidance and the dishes we tried were delicious and plentiful.
              
              So one small suggestion, if you're going too take this food tour, don't eat too much during the early part of your day or you won't eat all the dishes on offer for tasting.
              
              There's a really nice coffee cafe at the end of your tour, do try the egg coffee..
              
              Only seems available in the north of Vietnam..
              
              It comes either hot or cold, so if you're a couple out together experiencing the delights of this lovely city, please order one of each and share the taste of both together .

She was very careful to ask if anyone had allergies and preferences and would make arrangements for such. The actual walking part was not bad and you do have to be aware that there may be stairs and small seats to sit on but the experience is quite amazing. Ted shows various traditional Vietnamese foods and explain each one carefully before we tasted it. She also explained much about Vietnamese culture as we walked from place to place. What I really enjoyed is that she answered any of our questions about our surroundings or culture or what we saw. She also took us to the b rally which was fun to see. Ted's English was extremely good and we enjoyed the company from our fellow tourists as we had booked a group to her. for us there were five tourists with one guide which made it very easy to maneuver. This experience truly helped us to get a flavor for not only what the locals eat but the culture in which they eat and I felt like an insider.

Street wise!,"So much fun this tour! We were lucky to have this experience with our children aged 11, 13 and 15. Derek, our tour guide - blessed with a fluent English accent (acquired from Gordon Ramsay as he self professed) - showed us every nook and cranny of Hanoi’s old town and its hidden food gems. Ban cuon nong, bun cha, the best pho around town, topping all of it off with a cafe trung (egg coffee): what a treat! This young man confidently took away all trepidation we priorly had with picking up food prepared on the street corner and introduced us to flavours we would have otherwise never dared experience. We picked up great insights on the Vietnamese language and alphabet evolution as well as developments in Hanoi real estate along the way. A high octane, never boring and highly educational night on the town. Thank you Derek!","August 11, 2018",5.0,avm72,"Geneva, Switzerland",15,Family,

All were very nice friendly guys who were lovely to talk to and answered lots of our questions about life in Hanoi. They took us to a number of places for food and explained all about the dishes. Highlight was the egg coffee and egg hot chocolate which were delicious. These were places that we would not have found ourselves so definitely worth taking the tour.

A must do for any trip to Hanoi!,"Today, our tour guide Kelly, was waiting for us at our hotel and we took off on foot for the most delicious 3 hours ever. I want to start this review by saying that I am highly allergic to peanuts (I carry an Epipen everywhere) and as travelers quickly become aware, peanuts and Vietnamese food go hand in hand. Therefore, one might be surprised that I booked a street food tour in the first place but rest assured, Kelly guided us safely through the streets and spoke to the vendors clearly and checked the labels to make sure each bite I took was safe. She even went as far as to clean the chopsticks and bowls before we ate out of them! I was able to have a real Vietnamese street food tour thanks to her and we left full and happy with a whole list of new information about Hanoi and the people here. Kelly planned out 7 food stops but after we started to get super full, we went to two different dessert places, which was absolutely perfect for us. I can not recommend her enough and she truly made the tour a worthwhile and delicious experience. 10/10 would recommend!","June 15, 2018",5.0,Christina R,"Newport Beach, CA",8,,
Such a great tour I spent 3 days recreating it,"We went on a food tour with 'Bob' having been in Hanoi for less than an hour, and Vietnam about 4 hours after 30 hours of flights. All we can say is Bob was a fantastic guide who showed us much of the city, had great language skills, and even better sense of humour.
              

              The tour took us to many different stops, many of which you wouldn't even know they were there (I had a hard time finding them again!). The food choices were aimed at being authentic but friendly to the western palate and several of the stops had options to have a slightly more adventurous version (e.g. blood pudding instead of sausage).
              

              Our particular tour went to 8 different restaurants before finishing at a bar drinking bia hoi, all the stops offered reasonable portions considering you were stopping 8 times! We got very full, and very happy.","May 29, 2018",5.0,RickyTillson,"Tongwynlais, UK",80,Couples,

Must Do Tour,"My first night in Vietnam...my first night in Hanoi and what better way to explore the old quarter than going on a memorable street food walking tour with Bell.the group was small which made the experience even more enjoyable and intimate. Bell wove us through the alleys and streets of this hyper bustling part of the city tasting food that was fresh and danced on this westerners palate with enthusiasm and joy. It wasn't just the food that made the experience it was the facts and insights into Hanoi's culture and points of interest that you wouldn't get just by wandering around yourself.
              
              I would and have recommended this tour to anyone and everyone and will do it again myself when I make my return visit.","June 14, 2017",5.0,nvindis,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",22,Solo,
Dive into Hanoi,"This tour is a wonderful way to acclimate to Hanoi.  We booked our guide, Ha, through our hotel, but he has a website. Ha is charming and informative.  He takes you around to local street vendors and small shops to sample incredible food.  DO: try everything.  The food is delicious and safe. People are friendly and engaging.  Ha is a wonderful guide into Vietnamese food and culture. DO NOT: Eat before the tour.  Everything is delicious and plentiful. We went as a couple but this tour would be great for families.

We had a great variety of food and it was all excellent. We were all so full that we couldn't manage dessert or coffee at the end.

Great night out,"With a free night asked the hotel to see if we could get booked in for the night tour,  One of the best things that we did.  The group consisted of ourselves and a couple from London.  Our guide was well informed and took pride in what he was showing us.
              

              He took us to places that we would not have even known were there and the food we had was really nice.  Ate things that I would not have even looked at.   There was a lot of food and I think we all were relieved when we did not have to eat any more,  very full.  Overall  the tour was brilliant,  and would recommend this to anyone as a must do on the first night in Hanoi.

Best Food Experience !!!,"We booked this tour for a Saturday night which was our last night in Hanoi , and we where not disappointed. Our Tour Guide Duy truly made the experience one to remember. Before we even started the tour he asked what our food preference was and took us to restaurants that met our taste buds.
              

              Seeing the streets by foot is the best way to experience the Vietnamese culture and food.
              
              I do believe the only reason our was so amazing was due to the guide, he was knowledgeable and spoke fluent english.  The food we tried was unique and the way to eat and appreciate the flavors was explained and this was the best part of the trip.

              The amount of food served up is incredible. I must have eaten at least 9 courses+ within 3 hours. Ha was engaging and took his time in educating us about the food culture of Hanoi.
              

              This is definitely the food tour dreams are made of. Ha's personal touch is what makes the food tour so great.

Amazing,"I did the motorbike food tasting tour with Duy as my guide and it was amazing! It was a bit pricy,  but it was 5 hours and absolutely worth it. It was great to experience the city by motorbike and get a taste of what life is like by motorbike. Duy was a fantastic guide. He pointed out all of the famous spots and some lesser-known ones as well, along with brief lessons on their history and significance. I learned an incredible amount about current Vietnamese culture/society and it was nice to learn about the differences between today's youth and the older generation.
              

              Duy took requests for the food, so I like that there is a bit of customization available for this tour. Unfortunately I don't eat very much so I wasn't able to try more foods, but I was still stuffed from the iced coffee, bun cha, green papaya salad, dessert, and egg coffee. He gave tips on crossing traffic and took the time to give me a demonstration.
              

              At the end of the day he also emailed me recipes for the food we tried. I'm excited to try making bun cha and egg coffee when I get home!

If you're a foodie this is a 'must do',"My boyfriend and I booked the tour a few days beforehand via the hotel we were staying in and chose to do an evening slot of 6-9pm (I think the other slot we could choose was 12-3pm).  We were a bit apprehensive of being alone with one other person in case we didn't get on for some reason but there was no need to worry!  We were met at our hotel by Thanh (who asked us to call him Bell) who was very friendly and asked us about any allergies, special requirements, and any food we wanted to try or avoid.  We went to several places during the 3 hour slot but we didn't feel rushed at all.  We didn't eat full dishes at each place as Bell negotiated with the owners about us sharing dishes or having small portions which was perfect and meant we could try lots of different food places.  We would never have found all of these places without Bell and I highly recommend booking a tour.  Thank you Bell!","April 18, 2017",5.0,ImaginativeNameHere,"Manchester, UK",61,Couples,

              Our guide Thu picked us up at our hotel and then we headed into the old quarter to meet others in our group. There was five of us in total, which seemed like the right number.
              

              We visited 10 spots which included a mix of street vendors (ie satay, cane juice), sit down restaurants, and quick eat street foods.
              

              Our main criticism (which I think was common to the whole group) was that there was too much food being served/ordered at each stop. Instead of ordering one Noodle bowl and letting everyone have a taste, there would be three or four. By the 5th stop everyone was getting mighty full.
              

              Otherwise, we had a great time. It was a good group of like minded eaters and Thu, our guide, did a great job.

We had tried several kinds of very unique food and Ha explained the feature and uniqueness of each kind of good. Not only that we have tasted foods of different areas of Vietnam, we also have a chance to understand more about the food culture of Vietnam. There are several eateries that we might want to visit again by ourselves but we could not recognise the way.

Great tour to do first thing,"Deutsche is a great guide and extremely knowledgeable on all things Vietnam.
              
              It was suggested to me to do this first thing upon arrival in Hanoi and it proved to be the best suggestion. This tour gives you background on everything you see. It makes you look upwards and understand the architecture, the people ,the traditions and culture. Mostly it gave us the confidence to order from the street vendors which really do rely on flavour as their selling point because returning ( local) customers are their lifeblood. The upmarket restaurants are really not as tasty and don't care as much for return patronage because tourists are only there momentarily. Eating street vendor good is not only good for you. It great for your pocket. $$

He shared information on the restaurant owners, the streets names of Hanoi, how people live, and other places we should visit.
              

              The walking food tour was an adventure in Hanoi’s hidden, and overt, places to eat.  Dzuy shared the ideal places for Bun Cha, Steam rice pancake, spring rolls, egg coffee, and other delights.  He showed our travel companions how to cross the busy streets of Hanoi safely.  He went out of his way to ensure we enjoyed the afternoon.

At the end of the night he suggested some other places to dine and this morning we received an email detailing the places we visited and the suggestions he made for the other places.

Instead our food tasting tour took us to about 10 different locations where we tried a number of different types of traditional Vietnamese cuisine ranging from food that can be found anywhere in Vietnam to food local to Hanoi.  Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and told us a great deal about the history of different dishes as well as popular ways to eat different kinds of foods.  Though our tour stopped at around 9:30 PM our guide made it clear that he was certainly available to take us to more places if we were still hungry and wanted to explore more.

Being somewhat adventurous, we wanted to experience as much of the authentic, local food culture as possible.  However, we really didn't know where to start -- with minimal grasp of the Vietnamese culture, and no grasp of the language, it was difficult to determine which places were going to be good.  So, we signed up for the street food tour, hoping that we could get some guidance.
              

              We had an absolute blast.  We were taxied directly from our hotel to meet up with our small group.  In our case, we were with all English speakers from different parts of the world (Ireland, Colombia, and the US).  From there, we began our trek through the old quarter, sampling food at five different locations.
              

              We ate everywhere from restaurants to street stands to the upstairs of what looked to be someone's home -- almost all of which I would have never been bold enough to venture into on my own.  The food was varied and delicious.  We tried cha ca, spring rolls, shrimp cakes, savory sticky rice, bbq pork soup (the vietnamese name of which I can't remember) and egg coffee.  All were excellent.
              

              The tour guides were wonderful.  We toured with Nhung (Rose) and Quan, both extremely proficient in English, and well versed in the area and culture.  They were personable, professional, and very friendly.  Rose explained the history of some of the foods, and also the history and lore of some of the locations we ate at, which was super interesting and a step beyond what we expected.  The group in general had a great dynamic, certainly fueled in part by our guides, and we all had lots of fun.
              

              Afterwards, my friend and and one of the group members were interested in going to the night market and grabbing drinks, so we invited the tour group as well.  Quan volunteered to join us and it was great to have him at the market with us to haggle and explore.  We ended the night with drinks at a local beer place and met some more locals.  All tons of fun and still very professional.
              

              All in all, I'd highly recommend this tour to any age group.  If you like food, and want to have an adventure, give this a try.","May 7, 2016",5.0,Michael F,,2,Friends,
The Best Thing I Did in Hanoi!  5+++ stars!,"As this was my first time in Vietnam, I encountered a large problem...I wanted to eat all of the amazing street food, but did not know the correct dishes to order and what places were safe to eat at. The Hanoi Food Tasting Tour was the answer to my problem!!  Over the course of three hours, our two amazing tour guides Nhung (Rose) and Quan led our group of 5 through the winding maze of streets that comprise the old quarter, expertly guiding us on a culinary adventure!  Among many dishes, we sampled Cha Ca (Hot pot fish), bahn mi, savory pork belly sticky rice, egg coffee, pho, and a variety of spring rolls.
              

              However as equally as amazing as the food were our two guides Nhung and Quan. They truly went above and beyond their tour guide duties to ensure we had a fantastic time.  Our guides were warm, inviting, and incredibly knowledgable about both the cuisine and city.  They were also sensitive to our group's needs and tailored the tour to our preferences. Moreover after the tour ended, some of our group wanted to explore the night market and go out for drinks.  Quan joined our excursion and helped us to navigate the night markets and effectively bargain for our gifts.
              

              In summary, not only did our Hanoi Food Tasting Tour give us a great introduction into the Hanoi street food scene, it also gave us two new friends and some awesome memories.","May 7, 2016",5.0,mcoffel,"New York, New York",8,Friends,

"Food, fun, and culture","I went on a private street food tour and my tour guide was named Sunny. First of all everything about the tour was very professional -- the pickup at the hotel was punctual and Sunny's English was practically impeccable. What made the tour stand out though was the way that Sunny made the tour seem more like being shown around by a knowledgable friend more than anything else. She made a point to ask if there were any foods that I especially wanted to try or that I especially enjoyed. And over the course of the night we tried quite a lot of different things -- banh cuon (steamed rice pancakes filled with minced meat, to ""pillow cakes"" and egg coffee to cap off the evening. We also stopped by a fresh market and got to try some fresh fruit that I'd never tried before -- custard apples. In addition to explaining the food, Sunny was great at pointing out different things around the old quarter to help me understand the day to day life of the locals who live in the old quarter. The walk was at a pace that just about anyone should be comfortable with and we hit several restaurants around the old quarter and near the lake. So I highly recommend this tour for anyone interested and curious about Hanoi food and culture.","April 26, 2016",5.0,Brian J,"Warner Robins, GA",33,Solo,

Amazing Intro to Hanoi Food Culture,"First day in Hanoi I joined a food tour and it was great - both for good food and for meeting interesting people. Our guide Dui Pham was very knowledgeable and fluent in the ways and varieties of Hanoi street foods. After trying a wide variety of tasty local foods under Duy's supervision, for the remainder of my stay in Hanoi I was able to eat well every day and for a fraction of the cost of eating at the establishment restaurants. It was an experience that will continue to inform my Vietnamese food choices long after I've moved on from Hanoi.","April 18, 2016",5.0,andrewspp,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",7,Solo,
A great introduction to Vietnamese food.,"This was a great opportunity to try lots of local foods with a guide on hand to explain what everything was and to source the tastiest dishes.

Wonderful introduction to Vietnamese food!,"After arriving in Hanoi only 2+ hours earlier in the day, my wife and I decided to book a food tour through our hotel. On their recommendation, we chose Hanoi food tasting tours. The guide, Bien, was very good. There were a total of just five people in our group, so it made conversation and interactions very easy and comfortable. As many others have commented in these reviews, it was a great introduction to Vietnamese food. More than that, we got to seek out some locations and some particular foods that we might not otherwise have discovered. As we are spending several weeks in Vietnam, we decided that this would be a good beginning to our trip and help us out considerably in getting a greater appreciation for what to eat and what to look for.... not just food but also the wild traffic in central Hanoi! (I should add that it was only through Bien's careful guidance, that we managed to avoid getting run down by motor bike, scooter, or car in crossing the incredibly busy and seemingly chaotic streets.  Think: ""sticky rice"", his mantra for getting the group to stay close together.)

We went to 7 different places and Duy was great, telling us about the different foods and really a lot about the Vietnamese culture.

excellent walking food tour,I very much enjoyed my food tour today with Ha and Cherry. Ha is well known around the Old Quarter and has access to many different and interesting foods from market to table.  He not only focuses on food but also brings a little history and cultural mores into the conversation. His trainee Cherry is a university student who speaks English and French. She offered information on things that perhaps only women are interested in namely Vietnamese cultural dress and blossoms used for decoration and in cooking. I highly recommend this business.,"March 15, 2016",5.0,Edith404,"Copacabana, Bolivia",5,Solo,
Travel across Vietnam on Food (like on foot),"Ha was amazing, he made the tour very special!
              

              We stopped at many places, that have their own tradition and just focus on one meal or deserts. I did not count them but there were perhaps over 10 stops in the old quarted in 3.5 hours.
              

              Since they work for themselves they really put in all their heart at it, telling their traditions, family stories and cracking jokes. The group was only 5 people and Ha adopted the tour based on the group preferences.
              

              All of it was good while taking a walk in the busy neighbourhood full of locals.
              

              I loved green bean cake with green team! Try it :)

We took the ""lunch"" tour, which began around 8:00 AM with steaming rice pancakes (my favorite) and finished in the early afternoon.

Introduction to Vietnamese food the easy way.,"Having pre-booked this tour on the internet my wife and I did not know quite what to expect; what a pleasant surprise when Duy turned up early at our hotel and made us feel welcome in perfect English.  He took us all around the old town and through back alleys that we would never normally have seen as tourists.  We must have stopped at about 10 different eating places, both street eateries and restaurants, tasting various local dishes and drinks.  Particularly memorable were the crispy pancakes, deep fried spring rolls and egg coffee.  Duy showed us some jars of snake wine (we didn’t try it), the snakes are put into rice wine when they are alive and must stay in the jar for at least 3 years before the wine can be drunk).  Throughout the tour Duy gave a running commentary on the local environment, customs and history. Additionally, he taught us how to cross roads absolutely teeming with motorcycles and with no traffic management system to ever make them stop.

Delicious and informative,"My friend and I visited Hanoi in January and we heard about Mr Ha's food tour from friends of friends in the US. We did the afternoon 3 hour walking food tour and it was wonderful! Mr Ha took us to both street food and one nice sit down restaurant option...and Vietnamese coffee shop of course. So happy we did this, it was our first day in Hanoi and he took us all over the old quarter, showed us landmarks, visited a pagoda, got a little history lesson - all while walking and eating. All the places we tried were excellent, wish I had another stomach to keep eating!","February 3, 2016",5.0,MAL0715,"Chicago, IL",21,Friends,
Mr. Ha was amazing!,"My two friends and I took a night food tour with Mr. Ha (of Mr. Ha's Food Tours) about a month ago in Hanoi, Vietnam. With the culinary melting pot that is Vietnam, we knew we needed help finding the best, authentic Vietnam food in Hanoi. There were plenty to pick from as you walked the street, but we needed a real local to show us around.
              

              I picked Mr. Ha based off of a recommendation from a friend. She had just taken his tour 3 weeks prior to me and said that it was a must that we go on the food tour with Mr. Ha. We definitely were not disappointed!
              

              Mr. Ha picked us up, by foot, at our hotel that evening. He was extremely accommodating to my two friends and , and even asked us if we wanted a private tour by ourselves with no extra cost or we could pick up two others. We decided the more the merrier so we went to go pick up a friendly Australian couple. After this, we began our food journey.
              

              Mr. Ha took us to get authentic Banh Mi at one of his favorites shops and it was incredible. We proceeded to get some amazing pho. My parents were born and raised in Vietnam so I have been eating Vietnamese food my entire life. With this said, there were a few items I knew I needed to try while I was here, but they were not as easy to come by as your normal pho or banh mi. So at the beginning of the journey, I told Mr. Ha what I wanted to try and he knew just the right spots. We got to get some banh xeo, che, vietnamese eggrolls, empanadas, and a plethora of other foods you might not normally expect to eat. Mr. Ha took us around until we were all about to explode.
              

              Not only did Mr. Ha take us on an incredbile food journey, topped off with the sweetest egg coffee, he showed us the true Vietnamese culture by taking us back through an alleyway where one of his old friend's lived. She kindly made us fresh tea as we sat on stools and talked about the living conditions of the local Vietnamese people. Throughout the entire night, Mr. Ha explained the culture of Vietnam to us, giving us a true taste of Vietnam.
              

              I would highly recommend this tour for anyone that likes to eat and/or learn about the Vietnam culture. You won't be sorry!

My wife, being a vegetarian was seamlessly catered for and Nhung made sure to check the dishes we had already tried and where in order to tailor the dishes she wanted us to try and where.  All the food was excellent, and certainly no shortage of it!  In addition, Nhung also sent us an email after the tour detailing all of the dishes and stops we had made as well as a number of additional recommendations so that we could continue our foody tour of Hanoi with confidence.

We went to the whole old quarter and stopped at several small restaurants to eat some local food and I have to say everything was really really good - we were really happy that we made the tour.:) She gave us also a lot of information about the food, Vietnam and the city itself.

The day and time we selected for our tour ended up just being myself and my girlfriend. It was a completely personalized tour based on food we had not yet tasted (we tasted a lot of the local food as this was our last stop on our full trip to Vietnam). She switched up her suggestions based on what we wanted. Sunny spoke very good English and was incredibly sweet/easy and interesting to speak with. We even stopped at a few places along the way (Pagoda, residential alleys in the old quarter, church, historical landmarks) and she explained the background of each. Who would have thought that would be included in a food tour?!
              

              The tour ended up lasting awhile as we stopped at 8 places, which was great! A massive value for the money we paid. I would highly recommend Sunny and this food tour company.

Tasty!!,"Our guide Bich (aka Sunny) was so enthusiastic, informative and friendly - it was a delight to have her lead us from eatery to eatery to savor Vietnamese foods.
              

              While every dish ranged from very good to excellent, my favorites were the mango salad with dried squid and beef jerky, mixed chicken noodle, and egg coffee.
              

              We even walked down narrow corridors between buildings to the back alleys to catch  a glimpse of the living quarters of local residents - an eye-opening cultural experience.
              

              I highly recommend this food tour as an excellent introduction to some of the tastiest foods in Hanoi.  You will want to bookmark the places visited and return on your own for seconds!

"Awesome food tour, a must try experience!","A street food tour was definitely on my list of things to do in Vietnam. Hanoi Food Tasting Tours was an awesome experience- one that I would definitely do again.
              

              Our food Guide was N. Bich (Sunny) and she was great, really informative and full of knowledge about Hanoi Food and culture. She took us to amazing food places- some of which we would never have been able to find on our own!
              

              The tour started at 6pm from our respective hotels- Sunny picked us up and we walked to pick up others in the group (5-6 people/group). Once we were together, we started straightaway with food tasting- and that lasted till around 9-9.30pm.
              

              The food tour was really thoughtful and planned out. Throughout the night we must have tried at least 10 dishes (including various mains, desserts and finishing off with egg coffee!).
              

              It's also a great way to experience the nightlife (there are afternoon tours but I think the night food tours are generally the most popular).
              

              Finally, it's a good idea to be really hungry when you start the tour, that way you'll have enough stomach space to try everything!!","November 17, 2015",5.0,FEIYA Z,"Greater Sydney, Australia",12,Family,

A phenomenal way to experience Vietnamese food and explore parts of Hanoi that you wouldn't know about.,Hi Sunny!  Thank you so much for a fun Hanoi food tasting tour!  I enjoyed the food so much.  My Hanoi trip was much better because of the tour.  I wouldn't have been able to try so many authentic Vietnamese foods in one evening with such a super fun and knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide.  Another huge plus was being able to explore the back alleys of Hanoi to see where the Vietnamese lived.  Walking down the street you wouldn't guess that some of the small openings between the shops actually led to an alley with a fabulous authentic place to eat.  The Vietnamese desserts are to die for:)  Simply amazing!!!  Go Sunny!,"October 29, 2015",5.0,tknomad,"Cincinnati, OH",8,Solo,

Great food with splash of culture,"Great lunch tour with Ha that combined delicious local foods with a walking tour of the Old Quarter. Perfect for our only full day in Hanoi. We made 5 stops and were offered more, which we declined as we were too full. We walked many streets and alleys of markets between stops.  The first three were meals in themselves. We learned to wrap spring rolls filled with yummy Cha Ca (fried fish) at a restaurant. Next we stopped for Bun Cha (meatball soup), followed by fresh fruit in coconut milk, then Pho Bo (beef noodle bowl), topped off with tarro ice cream. The food was great and the overall tour more than we expected. Would highly recommend.","October 28, 2015",5.0,PattyD440,"Merrimac, MA",42,Friends,
great experience,The tour was recommended by the hotel and it was a great experience. Our guide Ha was knowledgable and enthusiastic.

You could discuss with him your expectations (e.g. we were not comfortable with eating anything too exotic!) and he would make plans accordingly.

Excellent food and knowledgable guides,"We recommend you do this tour as early in your stay as possible. that way you will know some of the foods to order and places to go. We had a great time on our group food tour in Hanoi. The two guides were so nice and enthusiastic and knew how to walk into any place and clear room for all 8 of us to sit--no small feat in itself!
              

              We went to 8-9 places and they gave us tons of information not only about the food but also about the local culture, the people and life in Vietnam. We really enjoyed going with a group because we got to see everyone's unique take on the food as well as our own American point of view. It was very fun and it also gave us 10 different places to go to where we knew some things on the menu. At one of the stops we got to acutally try our hand at making the food ourselves! We would have been reluctant to enter some of the stalls/restaurants since we wouldn't know the exact menu and also because the seating can be intimidating. And some we wouldn't have even known were there because they were down small alleys or places we would never have wandered.
              

              Our guides were obviously very proud of their homeland and very interested in showing us their foods and telling us about their culture. We highly recommend the tour. It was a wonderful way to spend an evening.","October 26, 2015",5.0,PuckandPoidog,"The Woodlands, TX",4,Couples,

Best Food Tour Ever,"Ha Nguyen
              
              Having only 24 hours in Hanoi, we wanted to maximize our stay. Through the La Siesta hotel (btw. a great, perfect place to stay in Hanoi) we hired Ha as our guide for both an evening and morning tour. The evening tour was a street food walking tour in the old (eastern) part of downtown. Ha does know the best places to stop for great food. All while showing us around the city we managed to make 14 food & drink stops. Within eight hours of setting foot in Vietnam for the first time we already had a marvelous culinary and cultural experience of what this wonderful country has to offer. The next morning he picked us up at 5 AM to go visit the flower market. From there, back to the city all the while stopping at the landmarks along the way. From the cathedral we continued on foot for a breakfast tour. By the time we returned to La Siesta we had sampled three more places enjoying breakfast with the locals. Here is the full list of all we tasted:
              
              1.Nem ran: fried spring roll

              11. Kem dau xanh: green bean ice cream
              
              12. Bun cha: vermicelli with grilled pork

Hungry in Hanoi,"This has been our favourite experience in Hanoi. Our guide, Duy, led us on a sumptuous tasting tour of the local cuisine. As others have mentioned, we simply wouldn't have thought to go into most of these places for food, partly because you have no idea what you're ordering. There are so many tasty dishes to find in Hanoi, you really benefit from the insider knowledge and avoid the tourist places. Some of the things on offer; shredded rice paper with beef jerky and quails egg, deep fried eels, sausage and noodles with vinegar/fish sauce dip. Plus many others. After the wonderfully light egg coffee, we finished up with some of the local lager (very weak but good taste and refreshing) served up from a keg at the side of the road.

For example, one place where we tried rice pancakes, it's in support of a woman who works from 7-9 every day, earning her bread, and then on Sunday makes food to give to the poor people for free!

Excellent food at places you might not normally try! Best activity of our trip!,"We booked a walking food tour as part of the services of our hotel (Hanoi La Siesta) and I am so glad we did! We paid through the hotel $35 USD pp which was expensive and since found out that there you can book direct from the tour group which may be cheaper (check out the website). That being said and having paid in advance we really enjoyed our tour, which lasted a little over 3 hours. Our guide was Mr Ha, a very knowledgable man not just of the street food in the area but also places to see and the architecture of the Old Quarter. He asked us what we had already eaten and if we had any requests (which we didn't not wanting to potentially miss out on a gem what we didn't know about!) so he can customise the tour for you. There was just us two on the tour which was nice. We visited Mrs Hanoi rolls and got then fresh out of the fryer and were delicious! Chicken noodles two ways, with soup and dry style, a typical fruit, tapioca and jelly dessert (which I would not have thought was my thing, and I enjoyed), freshly steamed filed rice noodle pancakes, sweet glutinous rice balls, freshly squeezed sugar cane and kumquat juice, grilled pork skewer, fresh local beer from the keg (very welcome at that point,) and to finish DIY bbq beef and veg, another beer and then ice cream. Clean plates at every stop! Water was got from the hotel and there were plenty of opportunity for toilet breaks. Great pace between eating and walking so you don't get too full too quickly. Lots of other things pointed out, including a house that is only 1 metre wide which a family of four live in! I would certainly recommend asking to visit Mrs Hanoi roll and the BBQ beef, although everything was nice. Great English spoken, no pressure for a tip, although we did as we enjoyed it so much. Also other places to try pointed out along the way that we didn't eat at. Great walking tour through the Old Quarter and well worth going to early in your trip to find out good local places to go for the future. Other tours I have heard about only visited three or four places, we had a great variety of small dishes of local specialities.

And this food tour came up, and we thought, hey, why not! We don't know a whole lot about the street food in Vietnam. So we booked it for that evening. Our guide, zui (didn't catch the spelling) picked us up from our hotel and we took a taxi to meet another couple at another hotel. From there the 5 of us walked up and down the old quarter for about 3 hrs making 6-8 stops at different places trying all different food. It was a great evening, and learned a lot of new dishes which we have since eaten at different locations since learning the names and identifying these dishes in different towns. It was a great evening.  And if there is anything you want to try that's out of the ordinary, they will make it happen. ( for example, dog meat)","September 11, 2015",5.0,Lindsey B,,3,Couples,
Great tour for first glimpse of Hanoi,"Our hotel, Rising Dragon Villa, offers this tasting tour. So right after arrived at the hotel, we asked the reception for the trip. Our guide was Mr. Duy, who speaks english very well. He showed us not only the food, but also different places of the old quarter.
              
              At the beginning, we was very scary about the total chaos on the street. We Duy showed us how to move and what you have to pay attention on when crossing the street.
              
              Thank to him, we had the courage to go around the city on the second day. This tour is the best thing to get first experience in the big city of Hanoi.","September 10, 2015",5.0,Tony N,,48,Couples,
Unforgettably enjoyable culinary experience,"Our tour guide was Ms. Sunny, a student of English and French at university. She brought us to eight street eateries, all of which served super yummy and healthy food. The selection was great and gave us the opportunity to taste a very broad and diverse range of Vietnamese dishes. During the tour she told us a lot of information and anecdotes about Hanoi, Vietnam, and Vietnamese cuisine. After the food tour she brought us to the famous Bia Hoi beer corner, which is extremely popular amongst locals and tourists alike. Fantastic value for money! One piece of advice: The weather in Hanoi is hot, so make sure to be dressed lightly for the tour, which lasts for ~3 hrs.","September 9, 2015",5.0,dragonbay2015,"Hong Kong, China",59,Solo,

Hanoi Tasting Tour - Exceptional experience!,"Our food tour with Ha Nguyen was a wonderful highlight of many on my sister's and my recent Vietnam trip.  We had many taste sensations and got to eat street food that we would not have known how to order ourselves.  Ha has an amazing knowledge of the Hanoi Old Quarter and obviously has great contacts.  When we asked about the possibility of duck - he rang ahead to the only nearby place selling duck to ensure it would be there for us.  Shortly after we arrived the roasted duck arrived, along with several other roasted ducks, on a motorbike (with a driver), and was chopped and delivered to our table shortly after.  We had so much to eat that I don't think we would have been half way through our tour when we had to call it a day.  Delicious food and so interesting to meet so many welcoming, friendly, local people.
              
              I would recommend a tasting tour early in your Vietnam trip so that you learn the names of the local dishes.
              
              Well worth it.  Thank you, Ha - just amazing!","August 25, 2015",5.0,Ali7591,"Tauranga, New Zealand",2,,
Do not miss the food tour!,"Our tour guide for our food tour is Sunny. And as what her name implies, she is as bright as the sun and we enjoyed our tour with her. We learned many things from her not just only about the food but also about Vietnam itself. The history, the way people live and go about their everyday life. The food we tasted were not the ones we commonly know about Vietnamese cuisine. We tried different kinds of food we thought we will never like. Sunny made us try really delicious different kind of dishes we ALL liked with no exception. I personally do not eat papaya but she made us try nộm bò khô or green papaya salad which I really really liked. My favorite of them all is Phở gà trộn or mixed chicken noodle which I prefer more that the infamous Pho of Vietnam and I didn't know this existed until Sunny introduced it to us. We ended our tour with cà phê trứng or egg coffee which made me hesitate a little thinking there was egg in my coffee but I was wrong, it was sooo delicious and creamy and frothy and just the best! Never ever miss the food tour when you go to Hanoi. All the walking will be worth it! Also, you'll be lucky like us if you get Sunny as your tour guide. She's really friendly and she will bring you to interesting places. She will make you feel like you've been friends for a long time. When we get back to Hanoi, we will definitely go for a food tour again. :)","August 24, 2015",5.0,cesfabro,"Makati, Philippines",50,Couples,
"Great guide, interesting way to see Hanoi!","Our tour guide Bich (Sunny) was excellent, she was so enthusiastic, knowledgeable and keen to please. She explained the dishes fully at each of the places we visited and also took us to some of her favourite places during the tour so we could sample additional dishes to what the tour offers, including a local ice cream! The tour is filling, so make sure you have space in your tummy! We were both worried about getting food poisoning, but the previous reviews put our minds at ease slightly and thankfully we were just fine - instead we got sick elsewhere in Vietnam in a normal restaurant! Not only did the guide explain about the food, but she also gave us some information about the city itself, which was very insightful and interesting to learn. Her English is great and she was pretty good at answering any questions we had. Definitely a very good way to try street food safely and different dishes you wouldn't necessarily order yourself! The tour lasts four hours so make sure you wear comfy shoes.","August 24, 2015",5.0,littletraveller85,"London, UK",310,Couples,

Excellent way to spend an evening!,"My husband and I booked a group tour through our hotel (Hanoi Elegance - also excellent) but turned out to be the only ones on it that night, so we got a private tour for about $10 less!
              
              Our guide was Bich (Sunny) who was warm, funny and knowledgeable as well as speaking excellent English (she studies English and French at university in Hanoi). We stopped at 9 different places and got to try delicacies of Hanoi as well as Vietnamese favourites. Bich was really helpful not only with getting us seats, ordering and paying but also in telling us the best way to eat each dish.
              
              The places that we visited were ones we would normally never have thought to go in and were mainly used by local people but the food was excellent. Bich even emailed us a list of what we had and where we had eaten after the tour in case we ever came back to Hanoi.

Above & Beyond,"Such a great introduction to the food in Hanoi! My guide Bích (Sunny) was amazing. Her enthusiasm and passion for not only the food, but the history of the city was wonderful. She went above and beyond and introduced me to more than I was expecting. Sweet dishes, savoury dishes, everything I could want. She also took me through some of the back alleys of the city and a temple, making the tour not only about the food, but also the history and the story behind the food. I paid $23 and I feel that I got more than my moneys worth. I would strongly recommend this tour to anyone who is interested in food and wants to get an up close view of the city and it's culinary secrets.","August 11, 2015",5.0,Vitkinj,"Hanoi, Vietnam",8,Solo,

Great introduction to Hanoi/Vietnam,"Let me preface this review with saying that I don't use tours (unless I have to, to visit an island or something), so I can't compare it with many others. However, my friend and I had an absolutely lovely time with Ziang, our tour guide. It was her first ever solo tour, but she did a great making us feel comfortable and answer our questions. She was very friendly and personable. She informed us all about Hanoi and she felt very natural and honest, and her happiness and excitement seemed genuine, unlike how I imagine (fear) other guides are. The foods that she introduced were simply incredible and served as a great introduction to Vietnamese food. The dishes included a chicken noodle dish, banana yogurt, shrimp spring rolls, beef salad, egg coffee, sticky rice with pork, fruit salad, sugar cane juice, and probably more that escapes my memory.  All of it was delicious (the egg coffee was the standout) and it's nice to try food that we wouldn't know about if we ventured out on our own.  If you want to experience legitimate Vietnamese food, check out this tour company.  If you want a charming and cute tour guide that will give you a comfortable evening, try to get Ziang.","August 8, 2015",5.0,Daniel L,,3,Friends,
private tour hanoi and perfume pagada,"Our guide Nhung Rose had an excellent command of the English language was very informative, polite and friendly the first day she guided us around the city of Hanoi and its main attractions with Rose and our driver we manage to cover most of Hanoi and still manage to fit in a great lunch at a restaurant suggested by Rose  who also ordered for us and the food was fantastic. We were so happy with the services we booked her for the next day for a trip to the perfume pagoda once again the tour was well organised and had a great day. I would highly recommend anybody with only a short time in Hanoi using this company as it worked out not that much more expensive for the 2 days for a private tour than getting on a bus with 30 others

Don't miss this - the best tour of Hanoi's street food,"While at first we thought this was a bit pricey ($25/person - actually not pricey compared to other food tours we did in other cities), we soon found it was absolutely worth the money. We got to taste around 15 different dishes, all in one evening, and felt like we had a new sense of Hanoi after we visited so many great places and learned more about the street food. Our guide Ha did a great job of mixing savory and sweet samplings, and also of ordering the right amount of food so that we wouldn't get insanely full at the beginning and then wouldn't be able to try everything (we saw this happen on other tours). Ha was also the best in that she shared a ton with us about Hanoi, food in general, Vietnamese culture in general (including talking to us about family structures, education, Confucianism, you name it) and taking us to some historic and interesting places that would be impossible for tourists to find on their own! We had a great time - would recommend to anyone. This was the best food tour we've been on in our travels.","July 26, 2015",5.0,Jordan D,"Oakland, CA",85,Couples,
A really worthwhile experience,"This activity was advertised in our hotel and was worth every penny. Our guide, Ha, was prompt and took us off straight away to try some pancakes. He tried to tailor the tour to our expectation and likes and spent over three hours with us trying all sorts of local food and visiting lots of establishments (or sometimes pop up bars with home brew beer) we all had a great time. We got to see lots of the old quarter and Ha was very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend it.","July 26, 2015",5.0,Matthew442,"Shanghai, China",6,Friends,
good introduction to street food,"Overall, this was a good introduction to a few popular street eats and a good tour of the old quarter. Though friendly, our guide (""Q"") was very perfunctory with her tour. She did not seem to really like any of the food or the experience which was surprising since we were so excited. Also she told us the cost was $50 per person, but then after I showed her the email confirming $25 she confirmed, which was just weird and unprofessional.
              

              Our hotel gave us much tastier recommendations for street food, but the efficiency of trying 7 places and ordering the best dishes at each is hard to beat with this tour. Would be helpful if they provided a list of the restaurants and foods as well.
              

              Would definitely do another food tour, but would try another company or would try to get one of the guides (Mr H and Rose) that everyone raves about.","July 25, 2015",2.0,Amy B,"Boston, MA",20,Couples,
Good Overview - Meh food,"There is some phenomenal food available in Hanoi. Of the 8 places we visited on the tour (restricted to the Old quarter and done on foot) only one of them is a place I might recommend to a friend. This is one of those things that is very good in principle but this execution was poor at best. Our guide showed up 15 minutes late and did not seem particularly interested in sharing the food of Vietnam with us. I will also tell you that my wife and I really love Vietnamese food and are typically very adventurous in our eating. Given how many incredible bites we had on the streets of Hanoi, we were surprised that the food on the tour was so forgettable. Conversely, every recommendation we got for street food from our hotel front desk team was incredible. If there would have been some instruction and dialogue regarding the origin, preparation or even method to eat the food, I might be more forgiving of the mediocre food. As it was I would not recommend this activity with this company.","July 25, 2015",2.0,Ted W,,10,Couples,

First time visit to Hanoi - a must do,"I booked a food tour via my Hotel stay in Hanoi at the Elegance Ruby. I considered that the best way to spend my first night in Vietnam in Hanoi in the Old Quarter was to do a walking food tour. Food price we paid included all food and drinks (including a beer, softdrinks and coffee).
              

              The Hotel arranged Hanoi Food Tasting Tours. Our guide, Mr Ha, as it seems he is a celebrity foodie tour operator. Mr Ha met us at our Hotel lobby and at the conclusion of the tour (2 1/2 hrs later), walked us back to our Hotel lobby.
              

              Mr Ha was very friendly, good English and very eager to please to ensure we were enjoying ourselves.
              

              We went to many different venues and one of the best things regarding this tour was that it was up to us as to the sort of food etc we wanted to experience. We ate from street vendors to small restaurants to coffee shops.
              

              We also enjoyed a glass of weasel coffee, coffees with egg and Vietnamese Ice Cream. At one of the restaurants, we cooked our meals, like a local on the path with burners – Mr Ha showing us how to cook the meat, vegetables, spices.
              

              If you are unfamiliar with the Old Quarter and are eager to experience food like a local in the Old Quarter, I would highly recommend a food tour with Mr Ha. I also understand that Mr Ha can arrange specialised food tours (eg. Drinking snake blood, eating rat etc if you desire).","July 8, 2015",5.0,BCME2010,"Sydney, Australia",589,Family,

"Stellar, do not miss.  So authentic, fun, and the perfect way to see Hanoi (and eat all the best food :)","I arrived in Hanoi as a solo traveler without having done a ton of research, so did a quick peruse online and found this tour highly rated - and now I know why.  This tour is not standardized, but rather is constantly evolving depending on what the group wants to see/eat, what is in season, etc.  Ha, our seriously exceptional guide in both being incredibly informed and super cheerful, made sure that we hit all the food items we requested, then added on a bunch of other specialties we had no idea to even ask for, and explained all the differences between north vs. south vietnamese cuisine, why certain things were being served in particular ways, and so on and so on - all while walking us through old town and giving a pretty thorough walking tour of the city too!  We ended at Beer Corner on a Friday night and experiencing the weekend scene full on - all in all it was authentic, fun, and the perfect way to see Hanoi.","May 29, 2015",5.0,Kinzie K,"Singapore, Singapore",1,Solo,
Adventures in Old Town,"We were fortunate to sign up for this tour on a whim. It wound up being one of the best things we did in Hanoi. Ha picked us up at our hotel with a few other wide-eyed travelers in tow. Away we went into the crowded and crazy streets of Hanoi. When we stopped at our first roadside stand and sat on tiny benches I had my doubts...but after my first bite I was completely hooked. For the next 3+ hours I would have followed Ha anywhere (and did!). Down dark allies, up tiny staircases and into kitchens that would serve up pure deliciousness. You can try to pick and choose your street food in Hanoi but I guarantee you it won't be as good or adventurous as the places Ha will take you. You'll feel safe the entire time (even on the perilous street crossings) and return at the end of the night full and completely satisfied. In other words, I highly recommend.","May 27, 2015",5.0,vang15,,10,Couples,
THE highlight of our Hanoi visit,"The first thing one should do on arrival in Hanoi is this food tour.
              
              In reality it was more than a food tour - it was an Old Quarter tour.
              
              Our brilliant guide was Mr Ha - he took us everywhere throughout the Old Quarter - down the narrow dark alleys to reveal lots of treasures that one can't see from the streets; up stairs in buildings we wouldn't have known to venture into.
              
              He taught us how to cross roads safely; gave us the history of the Old Quarter; and told us what all the different streets represented.
              
              And then there was the food!
              
              He asked what we wanted to try (and didn't want to try) and fed us accordingly.
              
              Talk about value for money, too - it was supposed to be a 2 and a half hour tour, but Mr Ha was in no hurry to leave us, eventually heading off after 3 and a half hours.

Great way to experience the best of Hanoi's street food with confidence,"After almost 3 weeks in Vietnam, we'd not plucked up the courage to try the famous street food, so with a few hours to burn before leaving for the airport we booked onto this tour through our hotel (the excellent La Siesta).  Even though we'd booked the group option, we got a private tour as the group size would've been too big.
              

              Our guide Ha was excellent - leading us through the streets and alleys of Hanoi's Old Quarter to try a selection of different dishes in varying establishments - restaurants, street corner BBQs, holes in the wall, seats on the street etc.  We got a great overview of the key dishes, what the locals eat, specialities, but were not asked to eat anything that Westerners may find strange (I'm sure we could have asked to though!).
              

              Ha has lots of tales to tell, and carries a multitude of photos on his smartphone so that he can explain/show things at the drop of a hat.
              

              We tried pancakes, pork, pho (obviously), beef, green mango salad, jerky, steamed buns, fruit, spring rolls and the famous Egg Coffee (delicious) and were ultimately defeated by the sheer amount of food.
              

              A great tour, highly recommended and we are pleased to report that it was totally stomach-safe!","April 22, 2015",5.0,Hamish11,"Pulloxhill, UK",213,Couples,
Memorable experience with a great guide,"My biggest insecurity about street food is that I don't want an upset stomach, and I don't want to accidentally eat something beyond my comfort zone.
              

              On the other hand, I want get the feeling of eating like a local.  I want to discover places to eat that lie at the end of narrow passageways, on residential side streets, up narrow staircases with low ceilings.  I want to have the feeling of having explored beyond the beaten track, and to luxuriate in the self-congratulatory reminiscences about my carefully chaperoned adventures.
              

              Our guide Ha delivered all of these things.  He helped our small group of 8 people with introductions to break the ice.  He asked about dietary preferences.  Then he took us on a walking tour of various tiny restaurants, places where he ate himself, places which have a track record of not upsetting delicate stomachs.  The food was never less than good, and often fantastic. While there could have been more in terms of commentary on the city and it's history, I thoroughly enjoyed my day out, and my only regret was not going to heavy on rice and noodles and not leaving enough room for the rest of the delicious food.","April 11, 2015",5.0,Michael T,"London, UK",2,Couples,
What A Way To Experience The Old Quarter,"By far, this was the best experience we had in Hanoi (there were 4 of us/2 couples).  We spent 4 hours with our guide, Ha.  He has a great personality, very upbeat, and extremely knowledgeable about the Old Quarter.  He was very flexible and focused on our tastes and interest, and at the same time making sure we covered what he wanted us to see/do.  We saw parts of the Old Quarter (small alley ways) we would never have seen if we were on our own.  The food experience was the highlight.  Eating well cooked food in the small street restaurants on tiny chairs was a lot of fun.
              
              Lastly, it was a nice touch to receive an email from Ha that summarized what food items we had eaten.
              
              If you are staying at the Golden Sun Suites Hotel (an excellent hotel/see our review), Ha, is one of the tour guides they recommend and you can make arrangements at the hotel desk for the food tour.","April 1, 2015",5.0,savvy2olympia,"Olympia, WA",169,Couples,
Tour of the old quarter,"Our guide, Ha, gave us a tour of the old quarter.  It was booked a bit last minute, but Ha was very accommodating.  He showed us the French architecture and told us about the history of Vietnam.  He was very flexible and focused on the things we were interested in seeing.  When we expressed an interest in knowing about the street food of Hanoi, Ha adjusted our tour into an impromtu food tour, showing us the good places to go for pho, egg cream coffee and cha ca.  He even marked those places on our map for us.  He gave us good information on how to bargain with the vendors and showed us the good places to shop.

Contagious Enthuiasm,"We first met our guide, Nhung, when she came to our hotel to pick up another group for a food tour.  We just casually chatted with her and decided that we'd like this kind of introduction to Hanoi.  We asked our hotel to arrange a tour but then had to cancel because I was sick.  We postponed our tour for a day and we were delighted to discover, when I'd recovered, that we had been assigned Nhung.  Just a coincidence but we all immediately felt comfortable.  I explained that I was allergic to garlic and still short on energy so she tailored the tour perfectly for us.  We walked all around the old quarter and went into restaurants that I never would have considered on my own.  We enjoyed everything we ate and I would have loved to continue but I just couldn't eat any more.  (We had succumbed to all the temptations offered by our hotel at their fabulous breakfast buffet so we were pushing our limits!).  Nhung was just delightful: fun, informative, flexible, and enthusiastic.  If we had more time here we'd probably do the tour again and try some of the many dishes we missed.","March 6, 2015",5.0,babznlulu,"Providence, RI",52,Couples,
FOODIES - An Amazing Intro to Hanoi Street Food - and an Amazing Guide,"I must say I was a bit sqeamish when my husband announced we would be doing a private street food tour in the Old Quarter in Hanoi. We trudged over to the Rising Dragon Villa Hotel to meet our guide. We were offered coffee and tea while we waited - me in nervous anticipation.
              

              My fears were soon wiped away. Our lovely, enthusiastic English speaking guide Phuong Ha was happy to listen to what I would and would not eat and soon had me drooling over her wonderful food descriptions. By the end of the tour it was clearly apparent that this young lady KNOWS great food and can back it up with entertaining stories, cultural tidbits, and a great culinary knowledge-base!
              

              Phuong Ha was so impressive that a table of tourists sitting next to us t one of our stops interrupted her and asked if they could hire her for a tour the next day!
              

              Every location we visited was exceptional and offered a new, untried Vietnamese culinary experience, accompanied by food history, recipes, preparation tips, and information cards. Much to my surprise the purple fermented rice with frozen yoghurt was one of my absolute favourites - along with pretty well everything else we tasted. ;o) Ha even e-mailed us a food diary with complete descriptions - a wonderful (and environmentally friendly) keepsake of our great tour.

              Our guide was very friendly, and helped us find places that had some new interesting food that he thought would be right up our alley. We went through a couple of hits and misses, but both me and my girl found new favorites that we will attempt to recreate when we get home, although I'm sure we won't get anywhere near the authenticity.

Perfect introduction to Hanoi,"When we arrived in Hanoi, my friend and I were overwhelmed by the hectic traffic, endless side streets, and innumerable restaurants. It was immediately clear that Hanoi isn't exactly an easy city to navigate for first-timers like us. Luckily, our hotel manager introduced us to the venerable Mr Ha - a local foodie who seems to know every person and restaurant in the old quarter. Mr Ha has a warm personality and genuine excitement for the food and places that were shown. We tried about 10 different dishes which were all excellent. He even introduced us to locals and gave us a general overview of the layout of the Old Quarter.
              

              Overall, I couldn't imagine a better way to begin our stay in Hanoi.

A true local perspective, and some delicious food to go with it.

Hanoi Food Tasting Tours,"My wife and I have great praise for Ha and his professionalism. He has good english,  was enthusiastic to share a culture that he clearly loves, attentive to our interests and generous with his time. Indeed, what was supposed to be a three-hour tour went for over four hours. The pricing was fair, we learned a lot and gained a fascinating view not only of the food but also the city life of old town Hanoi. We highly recommend Ha.","January 4, 2015",5.0,Colin J,"Calgary, Canada",2,Couples,
Great Tour and Even Better Food,"This is a must do if you're in Hanoi for any amount of time.  Unless you have a local guide, you will have NO IDEA where to find the best street foods in Hanoi.  Sure, you can always just try your luck, but for those who want a fun, social, and informative way to try out the tastiest street foods of Hanoi, I can't recommend this tour enough.  Ms. Phuong Ha was our culinary guide for the evening, taking us around to over a dozen different spots.  We couldn't have asked for a better guide!

Best way to learn about Hanoi and vietnamese culture and food!,"We recommend to do the tour as soon as possible after arriving in Hanoi. It is such a great experience! We were picked up by our lovely tourguide Hà at our hotel. From there she guided us through the old quarter were we tasted many different street food dishes. All of them were very delicious and you would never try or find the food on your own.

Delicious food in Hanoi,"This was a memorable experience, and I would advise anyone visiting Hanoi, to start by taking Ms Phuong Ha's Street Food Tour.

Her care of our family on the tour was wonderful. Thank you again, Ha.","December 16, 2014",5.0,pands71,,1,Family,
Amazing Food Tour!,"Stayed in Hanoi for a week as a solo traveler.  One of the things that was most important to me as a traveler to this area was the food, so I signed up for three different street food tours through three different companies during the course of my stay here.  This one was amazing, and I cannot recommend it enough.
              

              My guide was Ha.  She is an absolutely amazing individual, and you will find no one more passionate about the food and culture in Hanoi than her.  Her enthusiasm and knowledge really set this tour apart from all others.
              

              I explained that I had already taken two food tours, and was interested in finding foods that I had yet to try.  Ha completely tailored the tour to my interests, and I ended up trying twelve new
              
              foods that I had yet to see on the streets!  Most of the places we visited were local hotspots with no tourists, which also made this tour unique.  And the food was amazing!
              

              After the tour was done, Ha mentioned to me that she made a food diary of the entire evening. She actually emailed me all the Vietnamese and English names for each dish we tried.  No other food tour / guide did this, and I thought it was an incredibly nice touch.  Really helps to navigate the menus when you're ready to set out on your own.
              

              Other items worth mentioning is that this company will walk over and get you from your hotel if you're staying in the Old Quarter, as well as escort you back.  That's something some of the other food tours do not offer.  It's a great added service if you're feeling unsure about finding your way through the Old Quarter, or traveling solo like myself.
              

              Thank you, Ha!  This was one of my most memorable nights in Hanoi! :)","December 13, 2014",5.0,Raych,"Seattle, WA",11,Solo,
Perfect way to kill some time and eat some great food in the process,"This was the best way I can imagine being able to get a solid understanding of Vietnamese cuisine. Mr. Ha, our esteemed tour guide, led us through Hanoi via motorbike on an informative and wholesome 3 hour experience like no other. There were different styles of eggs, incredible pork dishes, rice everywhere, everything you’d expect from Hanoi plus more. Mr. Ha spoke very clear English and was incredibly polite. He basically asked us about our food preferences and then catered to them, making sure we got the most out of our experience. He even shared tidbits of interesting local history as we passed by certain buildings and locations. This tour is a must if you find yourself in Hanoi.

Great way to kick off your visit to Hanoi,"This was the first thing we did in Hanoi, and it was a great introduction to the city and its food, and really helped us get our bearings. Ha (Mr) was a great guide as he struck the right balance between being professional and friendly.  He was super interesting and informative, took us to some cool places we wouldn't have found otherwise, and we got to try a wide variety of food and drink, including things that, as a tourist, I probably wouldn't have eaten. I also really liked that it wasn't just food, we also got to stop off at different places to sit with the locals and have a beer, lemon tea and desserts as well. It was such an enjoyable evening, and I'd definitely recommend.","December 10, 2014",5.0,hannah7344,"Wellington, New Zealand",4,Couples,
Our first activity after arriving in Hanoi > street food tour,"Based on previous feedback from earlier Trip Advisor comments, our first activity in Hanoi after arriving was to book a walking street food tour. Both the tour and the food lived very well up to the high ratings that are currently being shown in Trip Advisor ratings. Our young female guide, Nhung Nguyen, hardly showed her age as she very efficiently pointed out the best of traditional Vietnamese cuisine as well as the more contemporary ones. She made sure that no one in our family group of three had any allergies to anything. Aside from giving pointers on the food itself, she also gave some historical lessons on the city as well as offering assistance whenever anyone in our group showed interest in buying souvenirs. Nhung was extremely attentive and ensured that everyone was well-fed at all times. With the cool weather prevailing in Hanoi, it made the street tour a very pleasant one as we made our way to different nooks and crannies in the city and most of the time finding our way inside eating places that we would never guess had great food being served inside. The tour was a very informal one and we shared a lot of laughs and jokes with Nhung as went merrily from one venue to the next. The street food tour done by this company (and probably others) because it removes the ""guesswork"" (do they have good food here? is it safe to eat?) and we are free to relax and enjoy the great & healthy local cuisine. It is extremely wise to do this tour at the start of your stay in Vietnam so we cannot underline how glad we are we put this first in our itinerary. It is a very high value tour. We also learned that the same company also offers other tours (historical spots and special interest areas) in Hanoi and are not just limited to the street food tour. When hearing of this, we proceeded to make another booking right away. This city is just sooo amazing.. And the people are very warm and ready to help at any time. This is GREAT tour with outstanding value!","December 8, 2014",5.0,Miguel R,,53,Friends,
Great way to learn about local food,What a great evening we had with the guide taking us to so many places to eat a great range of foods.

highly recommended!,"Our guide, Phuong Ha was a delight! Bubbly, friendly, personable, and knowledgable about Hanoi food and culture, she took us around the city to try everything we had hoped to try and more! The tour was extremely flexible and Ha catered to our preferences but also challenged us to try some things we were too timid to try on our own. Ha's passion for food came through in her descriptions of each dish along with her explanations about the differences in Vietnamese cuisine from the north to the south.

But the best thing about the 3 hour tour was Mr Ha's commentary and explanation of how to eat the food, what sauce/spice to dip it in, what it was and how it was pronounced should you want to order it again. He customised the tour to what we'd like to taste. As a result every tour is unique. We ended up drinking beer in a small alley, sitting on very small plastic chairs in a very vibrant part of town.

I would recommend every traveller to Hanoi to take up this tour as it was really value for money conduct by a great tour guide.","August 27, 2014",5.0,serene0309,"Singapore, Singapore",1,Couples,
The highlight of Hanoi,"So many people tell you ""Don't eat the street food."" With this tour you get to ""eat the street food."" Your guide brings you to various places to eat some of the best food you'll have anywhere. You meet the owners of these shops and get a feel for the culture. Just be sure your guide takes you to get Egg-coffee. Trust me. You'll thank me later.","August 27, 2014",5.0,TravelGuyVirginia,Virginia,49,Friends,
Great experience with their Tour by Motorbike,"When I recently visited Hanoi for a business trip, I took my girlfriend for a romantic week vacation. I was determined to make this a great trip for both of us when I wasn't in meetings, so I went to the concierge of our hotel and asked what would be a fun experience. They told me about this company, Hanoi Food Tasting Tours, and I decided to book a trip. I chose their motorbike tour of Hanoi and it's food, and I was not disappointed. While it was not too expensive, it was extremely fun. We rode around Old Quarter on a motorbike while tasting a lot of great food. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the experience a lot and are happy that we got to experience both the food and riding the motorbike through town. It's a really great experience!","August 26, 2014",5.0,ajsbuya,"Los Angeles, CA",1,Couples,
"Fragrance, food,colour wrapped in history and rice paper....yum","I had heard about food tours from a friend who was here recently and they told me to hook up with the hanoi food tasting tour and my guide ha was mentioned. I had no idea what I was in for but I was truly blown away by Ha's knowledge of the streets the food and the history. It was delicious and I tried food I had never tasted, I learnt things I never knew. Ha also catered to my tastes and my needs as I had a leg injury,we weaved a path through colour and sounds and my senses were on overload. In the end I was very satisfied indeed. Thankyou Ha","August 23, 2014",5.0,bodymechanicc,,1,,
Great tour! So much good food.,"We had wanted to do a food tour in Hanoi as we knew there was a great street food scene. We found this tour by way of an advert in our hotel. I'm usually a little worried about booking things through hotels but I'm glad we chose this one.
              

              We were met by the tour manager at the hotel and he asked if we had any dietary requirements and then informed us that our guide would be along shortly (he was guiding another group). A couple of minutes later our guide arrived (named Ha as in Hanoi, meaning river).
              

              She started walking us around the old quarter and pointing out various interesting things to see and explaining all the different things the street vendors were selling. We stopped at several different little street restaurants and tried so many different meals. The food was fantastic and there was so much to eat! The duck was especially good.
              

              Ha's enthusiasm for food and friendliness made for a great experience. She explained how the different types of meals fitted into the Vietnamese culture which was especially interesting. It was more like going out for a meal with a friend than going on a tour.
              

              I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in knowing more about Vietnamese food and culture!","August 16, 2014",5.0,TaffNoLongerInThailand,"Bath, United Kingdom",11,Couples,
Great value tours and suuuuper food!,"For a really great experience of local (and i really mean local) Vietnamese food, be sure to go on a food tasting tour! I would recommend the food tour by motorbike, as you get to explore other sites as well (and encounter firsthand the rather hectic traffic!).
              

              Definitely great for food lovers :)","August 13, 2014",5.0,joanlow,"Bournemouth, UK",197,Friends,
One of the highlights in Vietnam,"We did a 3-week-trip through Vietnam and took the tour at our start in Hanoi. Ha really took the time to explain us everything about the city, the food and its ingredients. The tour lasted about 4 hours and we visited 4 restaurants and also stopped at several little street food places. The food was just incredible and I don't think we would have seen and tasted so authentic dishes without Mr. Ha. Without a doubt a must-do while in Hanoi!","August 8, 2014",5.0,Robin M,Germany,2,Friends,

Good company makes the experience better,"Minh is an extraordinary boy. Brilliant, intelligent and knowledgeable. He guided us on a path of unique flavors with the utmost attention to my personal needs. I highly recommend it. The only suggestion I would give is that for some visitors to their first experiences in Asia (as well as in Africa and South America) where the tropical climate influences the smells coming from concentrated street catering, you have to prepare them for the possibility of encountering a concentration of smells that are very strong and different from European and other standards. I hope to reciprocate Minh in Italy, I wait for him to sit at my table. Thank you.","July 28, 2024",5.0,Paolo G,"Jakarta, Indonesia",28,,Hanoi Street Food Private Tour

Exciting - delicious - authentic - relaxed - interesting,"Minh (Dominic) picked us up on time at the hotel for our Hanoi Street Food Tour. He asked everyone about any intolerances or allergies, which I thought was very good! We went to 6 different places and the food was delicious and authentic at every place. Minh told us a lot about Vietnam; including many things that you don't read in any travel guide. Very talkative, humorous and open, in very good English, packed with some do's and don'ts and lots of tips, Minh introduced us to his Hanoi.

Enjoyed the street food tour with Minh as guide,"We did a street food tour with Minh and we were impressed by his knowledge of all the different dishes and his ability to easily adapt the tour to specific dietary needs. (One person in the group had a nut allergy and another could not tolerate gluten). The food was in good portions and all super tasty. Careful questions were asked about certain preferences for flavors and even structures so that everyone would be happy with the choices in terms of dishes.
               

               We highly recommend this tour with Minh if you are looking for a fun experience to get to know Vietnamese cuisine and also get information about the city, its history and facts about Old Quarter.","January 15, 2024",5.0,Wes,"Jaisalmer, India",4,,Hanoi Street Food Tour with local delicacies
